# Movie_Success_Predictor [project on-going]

## Problem Statement

The film industry is a highly competitive market with millions of dollars at stake for each movie released. The success of a movie depends on various factors such as genre, cast, director, marketing, and release date. 
Predicting the success of a movie before its release can help movie producers, distributors, and investors to make informed decisions and minimize the financial risk associated with the release of a new movie. In this project, I aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict the commercial success of a new movie based on various factors such as genre, cast, crew, social media activity, and historical box office performance.

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that would involve the following stages:


1. **`Data Collection`** : The data used for this project was collected from tmdb using their API end points.

2. **`Data Cleaning and Preprocessing`** : Once I have collected the data, I moved on with data preprocessing which included removing irrelevant data, dealing with missing values, and converting the data into a format that can be used by the machine learning algorithms.

3. **`Feature Engineering`**: ------to edit.

4. **`Model Selection`**: ------to edit.

5. **`Model Evaluation`**: ------to edit-Once we have selected a few models, we need to evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **`Hyperparameter Tuning`**: ------to edit- After selecting the best performing model, we need to fine-tune its hyperparameters to further improve its performance.

7. **`Deployment`**:------to edit Once the model is trained and tested, we can deploy it into production. This can be done by creating a web application that allows users to input movie details and receive a predicted success score.

8. **`Conclusion`**: ------to edit Finally, we can conclude the project by summarizing the results and discussing possible future improvements.
