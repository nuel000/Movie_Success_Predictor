# Movie_Success_Predictor [project on-going]

## Problem Statement

The film industry is a highly competitive market with millions of dollars at stake for each movie released. The success of a movie depends on various factors such as genre, cast, director, marketing, and release date. 
Predicting the success of a movie before its release can help movie producers, distributors, and investors to make informed decisions and minimize the financial risk associated with the release of a new movie. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict the commercial success of a new movie based on various factors such as genre, cast, crew, social media activity, and historical box office performance.

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that would involve the following stages:


1. **`Data Collection`** : The data used for this project was collected from tmdb using their API end points.

2. **`Data Cleaning and Preprocessing`** : Once I collected the data, I moved on with data preprocessing which included removing irrelevant data, dealing with missing values, and converting the data into a format that can be used by the machine learning algorithms.

3. **`Feature Engineering`**: Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features that can help improve the performance of the model. This includes features such as movie genre, cast and crew, budget, and release date.

4. **`Model Selection`**: There are many machine learning algorithms that can be used for predicting movie success. We can start with simple algorithms such as linear regression and gradually move to more complex models such as decision trees and random forests.

5. **`Model Evaluation`**: Once we have selected a few models, we need to evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **`Hyperparameter Tuning`**: After selecting the best performing model, we need to fine-tune its hyperparameters to further improve its performance.

7. **`Deployment`**: Once the model is trained and tested, we can deploy it into production. This can be done by creating a web application that allows users to input movie details and receive a predicted success score.

8. **`Conclusion`**: Finally, we can conclude the project by summarizing the results and discussing possible future improvements.
